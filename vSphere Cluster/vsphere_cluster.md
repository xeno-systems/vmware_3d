# vSphere Cluster
The Host, VMware, and APP/OS layers are connected with 6mm mangnest allowing for modular asssembly.
In the future I plan to have other products that can come together. 
Note: The OS and APP layer are glued together and create the cube that represents the workload. In the future, a Tanzu model will decouple the OS and APP.
